# MeshCore Analytics

A real-time analytics platform for [MeshCore](https://meshcore.io) networks. It ingests MQTT packets from `mctomqtt`-compatible observers, decodes them with `@michaelhart/meshcore-decoder`, stores them in TimescaleDB, and serves interactive dashboards plus public-facing site pages with live mapping, link intelligence, coverage modelling, packet analytics, and worker/system health.

---

## Features

- Real-time node map with animated packet arcs and live WebSocket updates
- RF coverage viewshed polygons per repeater using SRTM terrain data
- Link intelligence overlay with directional observations and path-loss viability
- Public repeater-topology explorer with hub ranking, graph components, likely bridge repeaters, isolated nodes, and multibyte-evidence filtering
- Map modes, shareable viewport/filter URLs, node detail drawer, and bounded activity replay
- Planned-repeater comparison with saved scenarios, share links, and overlap estimates
- Regional health scoring and predicted-versus-observed RF validation
- Local saved searches/watchlists for nodes, observers, regions, packet types, and incidents
- Privacy-filtered CSV/GeoJSON exports with a versioned OpenAPI contract
- Beta path prediction model with concurrent worker pool and hourly path-learning prior rebuilds

- Decoded live packet feed (Advert, GroupText, DM, ACK, Path, Trace)
- Stats pages and chart endpoints for packet rates, radios, hops, and activity
- Public Health page with worker status/history + server resource metrics
- UK site Feed page for public MQTT observer traffic visibility
- Repeater owner portal with MQTT username/password login and encrypted cookie session
- Owner dashboard with repeater summary, direct sender map, live packets, advert trend, heard-by list, link health, and alerts
- Multi-network ingestion (`meshcore/*` and `ukmesh/*`) with per-site filtering
- Isolated test-feed support via `meshcore-test/*` and `test.ukmesh.com`
- Multi-observer deduplication by packet hash

## Current State

- Split worker architecture for resilience:
  - `viewshed-worker` (coverage compute)
  - `link-worker` (link/path-loss processing)
  - `path-learning-worker` (hourly model rebuild)
  - `path-history-worker` (historical path resolution backfill)
  - `health-worker` (health snapshots)
  - `link-backfill-worker` (one-shot historical backfill)
- Path resolver runs a concurrent worker pool (`resolveWorker`, `resolvePool`, `resolveCache`) to handle high packet volumes without blocking the main ingest loop.
- Nginx frontend proxies use Docker DNS resolver-based upstreams to avoid stale backend IP issues after container recreates.
- Owner authentication uses MQTT credentials plus a separate owner-auth mapping database rather than public-key login.
- Live coverage is currently served by an RF radial model calibrated against observed repeater links and terrain data.
- Public/test feeds are isolated at the topic level, with `meshcore-test/*` excluded from the public sites.
- MQTT connection state is tracked via Mosquitto log parsing — connect/disconnect events are available in the health feed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/gadgethd/ukmesh.git
cd ukmesh

# 2. Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, MQTT_PASSWORD,
# and REDIS_PASSWORD.

# 3. Start everything
docker compose up -d

# 4. Check logs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

RF coverage and planned-repeater analysis are opt-in because terrain processing
is resource-intensive. Set `VIEWSHED_ENABLED=true` and start its worker only
when needed:

```bash
docker compose --profile viewshed up -d viewshed-worker
```

Local endpoints:

- Backend API/WS: `http://localhost:3000`
- App (ukmesh): `http://localhost:3003`
- Website (ukmesh): `http://localhost:3004`
- Dev/test site: `http://localhost:3006`
- Liveness/readiness: `http://localhost:3000/healthz` and `http://localhost:3000/readyz`
- API discovery/OpenAPI: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` and `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/openapi.yaml`

To expose it publicly, configure a Cloudflare Tunnel (see below) or reverse proxy of your choice.

| `POSTGRES_USER` | `meshcore` | TimescaleDB user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *(required)* | TimescaleDB password |
| `MQTT_BROKER_URL` | `ws://mosquitto:9001` | Mosquitto WebSocket URL (internal) |
| `MQTT_USERNAME` | `backend` | MQTT client username |
| `MQTT_PASSWORD` | *(required)* | MQTT client password |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(required)* | Password for the bundled Redis service; passed separately from the URL so reserved characters are safe |

| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:3002` | Comma-separated browser origins allowed for CORS and WebSocket |
| `VITE_APP_HOSTNAME` | *(blank — always shows dashboard)* | If set, only this hostname serves the analytics dashboard; all others serve the public website layout |
| `MESHCORE_CHANNEL_SECRETS` | *(blank)* | Comma-separated channel secrets for decrypting GroupText packets. Format: `name:hex` or bare hex. The default MeshCore public channel key is always included. |
| `OPENTOPODATA_API` | `https://api.opentopodata.org` | Elevation API endpoint for viewshed computation |
| `OWNER_DATABASE_URL` | *(optional)* | Separate Postgres database URL for owner portal username → repeater mappings |

---

## Mosquitto Setup

Mosquitto is configured for WebSocket-only access with password authentication.
After first starting the stack, add the backend service password:

```bash
# Add the backend client password (must match MQTT_PASSWORD in .env)
docker exec meshcore-analytics-mosquitto-1 \
  mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/config/passwd backend your_password

docker compose restart mosquitto
```

Do not create observer passwords manually. Provision every observer with
`~/bin/newuser`; it installs and verifies the publish ACL before enabling the
credentials.

The host helper at `~/bin/newuser` requires one or more full 64-character node
public keys. It validates the keys, writes and verifies exact per-key publish
ACLs, and only then creates the MQTT password. This ordering prevents an account
from authenticating successfully while all of its publishes are silently denied.
In MeshCore-HA, keep `{PUBLIC_KEY}` in the topic template; the helper requires the
actual key only to provision the server-side ACL.

---

## Cloudflare Tunnel (optional)

To expose the app and MQTT broker publicly without opening firewall ports:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) → Networks → Tunnels
2. Create a tunnel and copy the token
3. Add to `.env`: `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=<token>`
4. Start with the tunnel profile: `docker compose --profile tunnel up -d`
5. Configure public hostnames in the Cloudflare dashboard (example):
   - `app.example.com` → `http://app-ukmesh:80`
   - `www.example.com` → `http://website-ukmesh:80`
   - `mqtt.example.com` → `http://mosquitto:9001`
   - `healthcheck.example.com` → `http://mesh-health-check:3090`

For UKMesh health checks, point `healthcheck.ukmesh.com` at
`http://mesh-health-check:3090` in the same tunnel. The container uses the
internal Mosquitto WebSocket listener and persists observer/result state in the
`mesh_health_check_data` Docker volume. By default it uses
`HEALTHCHECK_TEST_CHANNEL_NAME=ukmeshtest` and reuses the existing `test:...`
entry from `MESHCORE_CHANNEL_SECRETS` via
`HEALTHCHECK_TEST_CHANNEL_SECRET_SOURCE_NAME=test`.

---

## MQTT Topic Structure

The backend subscribes to `meshcore/#`, `ukmesh/#`, and `meshcore-test/#`. MeshCore observers publish `mctomqtt`-compatible JSON envelopes to topics of the form:

```
meshcore/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/packets   # received/transmitted packets
meshcore/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/status    # node status advertisement
ukmesh/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/packets
ukmesh/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/status
meshcore-test/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/packets
meshcore-test/<IATA>/<observer-public-key>/status
```

Payloads are JSON envelopes containing a `raw` hex field (the MeshCore packet) plus metadata such as RSSI, SNR, direction, and hash. The ingest path supports 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte path hashes carried inside the raw packet.
