          <h3>Packet paths</h3>
          <p>
            The relay paths shown on this dashboard are a best estimate. MeshCore packets include
            relay node ID hashes in the width chosen by the sending node. Depending on firmware and
            settings that can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes per hop, so path resolution matches the exact
            hash width present in the packet against known nodes. If multiple nodes still share the
            same hash at that width, the closest or strongest candidate is chosen, but the actual
            path the packet took may have been different.

            <h3>Coverage map</h3>
            <p>
              The green coverage layer is a precomputed RF estimate built from terrain data and a
              simplified diffraction/path-loss model that is calibrated against observed repeater
              links on this network, and is biased towards areas near known repeater presence rather
              than empty terrain. It assumes the source repeater and the receiving repeater are both
              mounted <strong>5 metres above ground level</strong>. Actual coverage will still vary
              with local obstacles, foliage, antenna placement, and radio settings, so treat it as a
              guide rather than a guarantee of connectivity.
