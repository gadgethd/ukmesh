// Package sysinfo reads how much memory this process can actually use —
// Linux only, which matches every box this project actually runs on
// (Docker/LXC on Linux). Used to auto-size how much elevation grid memory a
// single geographic tile's demgrid.Load call is allowed to need (see
// compute.Engine's chunk-budget auto-sizing and cmd/hopreach-gpuworker's
// own memory report to the broker), rather than requiring a hand-tuned
// config value that has to be re-picked by hand whenever a box's RAM
// changes — which is exactly what happened repeatedly in production while
// chasing a real OOM: the same "how much RAM does this box actually have
// free right now" question, answered by hand each time.
//
// Prefers this container's own cgroup memory limit/usage over
// /proc/meminfo when one is actually configured — confirmed in production
// that plain /proc/meminfo can be badly wrong inside a container: a Docker
// container with no explicit --memory limit, run inside an LXC that itself
// only gets 2GB from its host, reported /proc/meminfo's MemTotal as the
// underlying physical host's full ~65GB and MemAvailable as ~18GB — neither
// figure bore any relation to the ~2GB this process could actually use
// before getting OOM-killed. A cgroup memory limit, once one is actually
// set on the container, doesn't have that problem: it's the number Docker
// itself enforces, so reading it back is authoritative by construction.
