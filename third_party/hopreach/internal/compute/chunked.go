// chunkGridBudgetBytes bounds how much elevation grid memory a single
// geographic tile's demgrid.Load call is allowed to need — see
// MarginsChunked and Engine.planningChunkBudgetBytes, which computes this
// per pass rather than using one fixed value. A whole-Scotland grid at the
// Precision tier's DEM zoom runs into several GB loaded all at once, which
// is what OOM-killed the remote GPU worker in production before per-tile
// chunking existed.
//
// At Scotland's latitude and a realistic ~78km link-budget range, the
// *padding* a single tile needs around its own edges (see padBounds) —
// required for correctness near any tile boundary, not a tunable safety
// margin — already costs ~1.1GB on its own at zoom 13, before any real tile
// content: no amount of splitting can get a tile smaller than that floor.
//
// This used to be one fixed value, hand-picked and re-picked by hand every
// time either box's RAM changed during a real production incident (the
// same "how much RAM does this box actually have free right now" question,
// answered manually each time) — and picking it too small has a real,
// separate cost: a tile budget small enough to be safe but far below what
// the box could actually support means hundreds of unnecessarily tiny
// tiles, each paying its own broker round trip, worker-side terrain
// fetch/cache-lookup, and GPU dispatch overhead — which is what made a
// real run take well over an hour per tier instead of the roughly a
// minute a single whole-raster job used to take before per-tile chunking
// existed at all. planningChunkBudgetBytes auto-sizes this from whichever
// box will actually load a tile's grid instead.
//
// defaultChunkGridBudgetBytes is only the fallback for when auto-sizing
// can't determine any box's available memory at all (sysinfo fails, and no
// remote worker is connected or has reported yet) — chosen to match what
// this project's own boxes have needed in practice.

// MarginsChunked computes one whole coverage pass the same way Margins

// planTiles), loads and releases one tile's grid at a time, and assembles
// the results into one full margins array — see chunkGridBudgetBytes for
// why: a whole-region grid at a high DEM zoom (the Precision tier, all of
// Scotland, zoom 13) can run into several GB, which OOM-killed the remote
// GPU worker (4GB RAM) in production, and would be just as unsafe on the
// website box's own 2GB if a pass ever fell back to local/CPU.
//
// supersample matches the caller's own supersample factor (1 = none):
// imageWidth/imageHeight are the *compute* resolution (already multiplied
// by supersample), and when supersample > 1 the returned buffer is
// downsampled to imageWidth/supersample x imageHeight/supersample —
// computed one geographic tile at a time, immediately after that tile's
// own margins are ready, rather than assembling the entire
// full-supersampled-resolution raster before downsampling it in one big
// pass at the end. That distinction is what fixes a real production OOM:
// the whole-pass buffer used to be sized at full compute resolution (e.g.
// ~1.1GB for a 12000x24246 Precision raster at supersample=2) regardless of
// how small the *served* resolution actually was — a supersample=2 pass's
// own final output is only a quarter that size. Downsampling per-tile
// means the one whole-pass-lifetime buffer this function holds is sized at
// *served* resolution throughout, never the larger compute resolution.
// Requires imageWidth/imageHeight to be exact multiples of supersample
// (always true from RasterSupersampledChunked, which derives compute
// resolution as served resolution times supersample).
//
// This is the entry point Precision-tier rendering uses instead of
// Margins; the caller no longer loads a grid up front at all.
