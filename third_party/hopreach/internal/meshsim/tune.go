// plain "please wait": a real scenario's candidate grid (with Attrs
// provided) is well over a hundred rules, each evaluated across req.Trials
// full simulation runs, and this whole call was previously fully
// synchronous on whichever thread invoked it — on the browser's main
// thread that meant a genuinely frozen page for the entire search, not
